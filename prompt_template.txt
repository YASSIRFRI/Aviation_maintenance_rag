When servicing bottle found the batteries in the bottle corroded, possible causing a spark in the bottle. Note the airplane number was just generated (aircraft that the bottle came off is unknown) for this form to be completed. Have the B787 bottle checked more frequently (there is a longer time frame on the B787 bottles -due to the bottle), hydrostatic test and due date are longer times than the standard bottles on the other fleets. This B787 only gets checked w hen it needs servicing. Note I have seen (2) other times during servicing of this style of bottle -that had corroded batteries. They were both found because the test that gives you a green light was not coming on. Synopsis Maintenance Technician reported finding corroded batteries in a B787 portable oxygen bottle.

Question:
During a high-altitude cruise at FL350, the #2 engine’s N1 spool dropped by 8% within 30 seconds, accompanied by a low-oil-pressure EICAS advisory and faint metallic vibration. Technician suspects either a bleed-air leak in the HP system or a faulty pressure sensor—what step-by-step troubleshooting should be applied?
