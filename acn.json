As the crew \nchief assigned with the aircraft, I requested a defuel of the aircraft because it had \n22,000lbs total fuel. The Aircraft Maintenance Manual (AMM) does not call for a d efuel but \nI decided it was best as a precaution. The aircraft was eventually defueled to 13,000 lbs \ntotal fuel but was imbalanced with fuel in the right wing tank. I instructed the mechanic to \npump all of the fuel into the center tank which resulted in rou ghly 8000lbs of fuel in the \ncenter tank and the remaining fuel in the left wing. Once the fuel was moved, the \nmechanic began the removal procedure of the fuel pump in accordance with the AMM. All \nprecautions and steps were followed. During the removal of t he pump, the slide valve \nremained on the pump and was pulled from the wing tank as one unit. The slide valve was \ntightly sealed with O -rings on the fuel pump which prevented it from separating from the \npump as it should have per the AMM. This caused a fuel  leak from the wing. The mechanic \nimmediately tried to stop the leak but was unable to successfully put the fuel pump back \nin place. He then contacted me by phone. I immediately went to the aircraft. I contacted \nmanagement and was told that the fire depart ment was already notified. Many mechanics, \ncrew chiefs, and supervisors immediately got spill kits and attempted to contain the fuel. \nMechanics were able to then separate the slide valve from the fuel pump on the ground \nand slide it into place on the wing to stop the leak. We then cleaned the spill. The slide \nvalve is supposed to be locked in place by a flange. The flange is very small and easily \nworn, about the size of half a 3/16 washer. The pump was very sealed into the slide valve, \nso when it was remove d, it came out as one assembly past the flange. In addition, the \ncenter fuel tank gravity fed fuel into the right wing which caused the large spill even after \ntaking extra precautions to defuel the wing tank. Suggestions: There needs to be more \ndetails in the AMM as precautions to take when removing a fuel pump. The Aircraft \nMaintenance Manual does not suggest defueling the tank before removal of the pump. The \nAircraft Maintenance Manual also does not caution in the removal procedures that on A321 \naircraft the center fuel tank will gravity feed into the wing tanks if the center tank has less \nfuel. This spill could have been easily avoided if that precaution was present in the \nremoval of the fuel pump reference.  \nSynopsis  \nAircraft Technician reported lack of key information in A321 aircraft maintenance manual \nwhen removing a fuel pump lead to fuel spill."

The report generated from the aircraft stated the \nwarning message (F/CTL FLAPS LOCKED, SFCS). Failure messages included: (FLP  1 CHK \nLH MECH DRIVE, AND FLP 2 CHK LH MECH DRIVE). We failed to receive any kind of \nturnover due to the fact that morning shift was the last to touch the aircraft, and swing \nshift was waiting on parts, so by the time the midnight crew arrived, we had no d irection \non where to start besides searching through scattered paperwork in search of where to \nbegin maintenance. We concluded that a previous shift found damage to the track 3 \nsystem and based off our manual instructions for the associated faults, we proc eeded as \nsuch to inspect for more damage. By the end of the shift, we discovered more underlying \ndamage of the flap system which included track 3 and track 4 (the outboard flap), and \npotential damage to the inboard flap system (track 1 and 2). Us AMTs crea ted a copious \namount of non -routine items for tracks 3 and 4, and nothing for track 1 and 2. We were \ntold by a crew chief to hold off on writing up a potentially worn attaching link of the track \n2 inboard flap, due to the fact that since track 3 was remove d, it could have caused play in \nthe inboard flap system. We were told that the next shift will check out track 1 and 2 when \ntrack 3 was reassembled. This is a failure on our behalf to write this particular item up. \nWhen the aircraft left ZZZ, we proceeded to check documentation, and did not find \nanything regarding inspection of the LH track 1 and 2 system, but rather a GVI (General \nVisual Inspection) of the LH flap system, in which we are unsure if that was included. The \nfollowing night after we were assign ed to the aircraft, management decided that the crew \nchief from the day before will no longer be able to have that aircraft, and they wanted a \nwhole new crew to be assigned to it. Our opinion was that due to the immense amount of \nwrite ups the day prior, m anagement felt as if it caused an operational delay in production. \nMind you, this is suspected by us AMTs. As techs searching for a flap failure, we felt as if \nthere was an unjust pressure and judgement against us by scrupulously following the \napproved mai ntenance manual references. This feeling of a \"push\" in order to have \nforward progress in regard to aircraft repair seemed to become overwhelming as the night \nprogressed. This type of operational pressure and feelings of being wanted to \"look the \nother way \" is a dangerous work practice when attempting to make possibly consequential \nairworthiness decisions, especially regarding an emergency landing flight control issue with \nour innocent passengers onboard. Cause: Saturation of write ups for damage found, and  \npressure for forward progress regarding work production in order to get the aircraft out as \nsoon as possible for revenue service. Contributing factors regarding why this happened \nalso includes preemptive decision making by our crew chief without reference  material \nregarding our track 2 inboard flap concern. Solution: \"Judgement free\" expectation for \nwriting up suspected damage or confirmed damage/failures. Management pressure \nexpectations to be reduced, due to the fact that the AMTs and Crew Chiefs have th e \nultimate and final say on airworthiness decisions. We are told that management expects \nwrite ups and issues throughout the night on an OTS aircraft, but in turn show the \nopposite by failure of their word by inducing pressure. Most of these situations whe n later \ntalked about seem to be disregarded as not a big deal and expected to happen based off \nexperience of what supervision has seen, but when it comes to the actual event occurring, \nthis ideology changes.  \nNarrative: 2  \nOn the night of Day 0 working into Day 1 I was part of OTS (Out of Service) crew assigned \nto an A/C. After a complete lack of briefing and or turnover from anyone of the techs or \ncrew chiefs of swing shift due to the fact they did not work the A/C and day shift was the \nlast ones to do so and they never left a turnover for them either, at which point we had to \ndeduce where the A/C was left off just from non routine write ups and from visually \nexamining what was removed. Failure of the turnover had us start a t the beginning thus \ninspecting the report and associated faults which were for a FLP1 CHK MECH DRIVE and \nFLP 2 CHK LH MECH DRIVE, with this information in hand we looked over the L/H wing on \nthe aircraft and found that Track 3 was disassembled and was fou nd to have mechanical \nfailure in a few major parts. As we restarted all troubleshooting from scratch we performed \na visual inspection of the area and found numerous discrepancies that were noted on non \nroutine paperwork, out of which one discrepancy for a loose/worn attach link on FLAP 2 \nwas to be left unwritten at the request of crew chief on duty due to the fact Track 3 was \ndisassembled at the time there was no way of knowing any effects from that that would \ncreate issues/looseness to Track 2. This is a f ailure on us as techs to write up the issue \neven against the wishes of the crew chief. Upon the aircraft final sign off we reviewed the \nsign offs done here in ZZZ and noted that our concern was never addressed about the #2 \nflap even though the initial faul ts to the system were for Track1 and Track2. Even before \nthe aircraft left ZZZ we had our doubts about management over involvement during the \ncourse of the aircraft ’s OTS time here. The night of Day 1 we were not reassigned to the \naircraft and neither was our crew chief due to managements concerns over the copious \namounts of non routines generated the previous night shift, the constant pressure from \nmanagement involve ment towards an operational goal and not towards the actual safety \nwas constantly felt and was observed by most everyone that had involvement in aircraft ’s \nstay here and the ultimate reason that both techs and crew chiefs were under such \nridiculous sustained pressure and scrupulous oversight was why ultimately the aircraft left \nwithout certain aspects of possibly unserviceable items to have been overlooked and thus \nletting an aircraft full of paying customers leave this station in questionable airworthiness \nand this issue has been an issue with our local management during every single OTS \nevent. Cause: Pressure for aircraft progress at no regard to procedure s, or restrictions to \nsuch procedures be it by equipment and or time, operational needs of the A/C being \npushed against the airworthiness needs of the A/C, numerous crews of AMTs and crew \nchiefs being rotated through in hopes that they will find a crew tha t would comply with \nmanagement requests better then the others and in hopes of bending/breaking some \nregulations for the operational need. Broken and/or missing equipment/tooling, \nimproper/missing turn over paperwork from AMT and/or crew chiefs, decision m aking from \nsupervision without any kind of paperwork or written approved deviation from reference \nmaterial. Solution: Management pressure needs to stop, it is extremely unsafe and they \nespecially good at inducing fear of being reprimanded into new and youn g AMTs during \ntheir probationary periods and they continue this trend of bullying into submission \nafterwards, at a time the A/C is OTS it is up to the AMTs and the Crew chiefs as to proper \nand correct actions as per our FAA approved reference material and any kind of deviation \nfrom such reference material with written authorization if needed. The operational needs \nof the A/C will and should always come in second place to safety. Technicians should not \nbe scrutinized or looked down upon for doing their sworn  duty to maintain the A/C in a \nairworthy condition as instructed to do so by the FAA rules and regulations and by the \nreference material that were agreed upon by the FAA and our company.  \nSynopsis  \nMaintenance technicians reported that while they were working on an aircraft with a flap \nissue the company management was not supportive of AMT's working to find root cause of \nthe problem."

When we receive the bottles, the squibs are installed on them and have  only a \nnon-ESD plastic cap over the squib connectors. The squibs should have shunts on from the \nmanufacturer, what are the venders doing with them? I brought this up in the past when \nthere was only 1 cap in house. We were told we should make shunt caps via a supplement \ndue to no inventory. Whoever is, doing the inspections, testing, shipping and squi b tag \nshould be aware of the need for the shunts at all times until installed on the aircraft. \nSuggestion: 1st educate the venders and shippers of the hazards associated with the \nsquibs. 2nd make sure the squibs are shipped handled and stored with shunt ca ps on at all \ntimes. 3rd cartons need to be properly labeled as to the hazards contained inside.  \nSynopsis  \nAir carrier maintenance personnel reported the improper shipping and handling of fire \nextinguisher bottles.

I \ncompleted the Tail Rotor section and all that entailed. Our maintenance facility was \nrecently made aware that the pilot was performing his preflight inspection after receiving \nthe aircraft from scheduled maintenance when he noticed the tail rotor gearbox oil cap \nwas not installed. I was the individual who installed the cap, and another AMT verified its \ninstallation by performing a Safety and Security Check (SSC). At this point, the aircraft \nwas looked at by two individuals who verified the cap was installed. After receiving \nnotification of the cap not being installed, we talked amongst ourselves here at our \nmaintenance facility and there are several other people, to include 2 pil ots, that saw that \nthe cap was installed prior to the Operational Check Flight (OCF) and the aircraft's \ndeparture from our facility to its destination. The aircraft underwent ground -runs and an \nOCF prior to leaving our facility with no visible signs of oil  coming from the gearbox or \nanywhere else.  \nNarrative: 2  \nDuring 300 HR upon completion of servicing and inspection of the tail rotor gearbox area I \nwas tasked with conducting a safety and security check (SSC) of the area prior to the \ncowling being installed. At the time of my inspection everything appeared and f elt secure. \nAfter this action the aircraft underwent several ground runs with no evidence of oil \nleakage. It was also noted by other mechanics as well as pilots that the oil cap was \ninstalled at this time. The aircraft was then flown back to its destinatio n. Upon arrival at its \ndestination, during a preflight inspection, it was discovered the tail rotor gearbox servicing \ncap was not installed.  \nSynopsis  \nHelicopter maintenance technicians reported that after scheduled maintenance they \nlearned a pilot discovered during preflight inspection the tail rotor gearbox oil cap was not \ninstalled."

Operative detector loops are verified to \noperate normally once each flight day. Once each flight day, verify each operative detector \nloop operates normally. Apply heat from an appropriate heat source to a detect or element \nin the loop. The substitute test heat device must not produce heat greater than 450 \ndegrees F. The temperature limit should be observed in the event fuel vapors exist in the \narea. It goes on to what to expect during the heat test. I found that t he MEL can be \ninterpreted as meaning to check each and every segment in the loop or the loop in total. If \nto check it in total, it does not say where or provide a maintenance reference for the AMM \n(Aircraft Maintenance Manual) to use to prove this test. It  offers no approved tool to use to \nincrease the temperature of the probe into the test range. If you are to check each and \nevery loop segment that is part of the full loop individually, this task is near impossible in \nthe turn environment it was provided to me in. In speaking with Maintenance Control they \nsaid you just test the loop anywhere. But my concern there is that you could have multiple \nfaults that compromised much more than one area. When you look in the IPC (I llustrated \nParts Catalog), each segment of the major loop is called a loop unto itself. So without an \napproved Aircraft Maintenance Manual procedure for this heat task it leaves far too much \nto interpretation that I believe it should. Suggestion: I would h ave a specific Aircraft \nMaintenance Manual or Work Order listed that compels the Technician onto what the \nintended procedure, and what tooling approved to use for this.  \nSynopsis  \nB737 MAX 8 Technician reported the MEL procedure on testing the fire detection loop was \nvague and needs to provide more information and direction."

Landing gears doors were \nalready in the down position. The Lead [Person 3] assigned us with removing the \naccumulator that was, causing a hydraulic leak. The Lead and I pulled breakers, \ndepres surize the system, removing the head pressure. We removed the bottle placed on \nthe table, replace the valve and packing reinstalled the bottle pressurize the system and \nthe Lead pushed in all the breakers. then we refilled the green hydraulic reservoir. Th e \naccumulator still leaked, we received a new accumulator we replaced it, Person 2 and the \nLead proceeded to go upstairs to the flight deck. The Lead was in an hurry to get the job \ndone before night shift came on. The Lead stowed the manual gear drop and p roceeded to \nturn on the system approx XE00 hours. At that time I was next to the green hydraulic \nsystem reservoir I went around to where the ladder that was inside the wheel well to look \nif the accumulator was leaking at that time before even knew it, the landing gear and \nladder was lifting up and pushing me towards the landing gear wheel. My legs were caught \nin between the ladder. Person 4 next to me, screamed to get out of the way I wasn't quick \nenough. He tried radio over the radio to stop for me. I was able to get one foot out and \nget out of the way from the wheel, and then the ladder went up into the wheel well with \nthe landing gear closing behind it. Suggestion: Slowing down.  \nNarrative: 2  \nThere were three AMTs that were farmed out from the terminal to the hangar, we arrived \nat XA30 and were given a task to finish 2 service on another aircraft on the west ramp at \nspot X. At around XC00 we were then called out over the radio by our Lead to he lp find the \nproblem as to why we had an air return on Aircraft X, the original write up was that the \npilots reported losing all HYD pressure in the green system after takeoff causing him to \nmanually drop the landing gear. The landing gear pins were already  installed and we were \ntold by Lead to standby, as he was going to pressurize HYDs in order to locate where the \nleak was coming from. We found the leak and were then instructed to begin removing the \naccumulator while the Lead went to locate and order our p arts, we began to pull circuit \nbreakers and depressurizing the green system in order to take the accumulator off. This \nwas accomplished, aside from receiving parts which then arrived around XE30, which was \njust the joiner and the packing, after installing and leak checking, the leak was still \npresent and bottle needed to be changed along with the joiner and packing, which we then \nwere met by Person A, he assisted in finding the accumulator. after install, around XG00 \nPerson 3 and I went to the cockpit to pr essurize HYDS after getting the all clear From both \nPerson A and Lead, Person 3 then stowed the manual gear down handle and pressurized \nHYDs, the gear doors then came up pinching Person 1 between the ladder and the MLG \ninboard tire, thankfully he was able to get out in time and only resulted in minor bruises \nand scrapes. Suggestion: The crew working the job should be the ones touching and \ncarrying out the tests and work. We needed to be more safe when it came to locking out \nthe gear doors, but the configura tion of the plane wouldn't have been changed if the \noriginal crew was working the problem. No matter the time crunch.  \nNarrative: 3  \nAircraft X had lost green sys hydraulic quantity after taking off flight crew accomplished a \nmanual gear extension after an overweight uneventful landing aircraft was recovered by \nthe ramp taken to a gate unloaded and eventually towed to the hanger MLG doo rs \nremained down and the manual extension handle still deployed sufficient hydraulic \nquantity remained so hydraulic power was applied to confirm source of leak I had assigned \nthree technicians to replace the green sys hydraulic accumulator and ordered part s needed \nto fix the leak then my attention was on three other aircraft that were out of service \nincluding one that I had to take out for a run. I was the only qualified mechanic on shift to \ndo so several hours later I stopped by to see how work was progres sing on Aircraft X they \nhad replaced a fitting and o ring on the accumulator serviced and re -pressurized the \nhydraulic system and it was still leaking we located the new accumulator and I assisted \nwith its replacement then I went to the cockpit accidentall y hit my knee on the manual \ngear extension handle so i cranked it to normal stowed position and with clearance applied \nhyd power and the gear doors came up and pinched a ladder that had been used for \naccess causing damage to the door and to the ceiling of the MLG. Suggestion: Any time \nthe MLG doors are down the collars / locks need to be installed and the manual \nmaintenance access handles need to be pulled and safeties pins installed regardless of the \ncondition or position of the doors are in when the aircr aft is brought into the hanger or for \nthat matter wherever the aircraft is because there had been three prior applications of \nhydraulic power prior to this event without incident and my distractions dedicated to other \nout of service aircraft and no prior e xperience on the aircraft type by the three new \ntechnicians i had assigned to this job all contributed to this very serious incident.  \nNarrative: 4  \nPerson 1 and I were instructed by our Lead [Person 3] to come and look for hydraulic leak \nwhile he goes up in the cockpit to turn the pumps on. We found the leak coming from the \ngreen system accumulator and asked him to shut off the hydraulic pumps. He com es down \nand instructed us to depressurize the green system, and remove the on nut that is holding \nthe accumulator in place. The MLG gear doors were already opened and there was other \nmechanics working on a different task (overweight landing). So the accumulator was \nremoved after depressurization, a new o ring and fitting were installed and the whole th ing \nwas put back together. We did a leak check and it was still leaking. Lead ordered a new \naccumulator bottle and instructed us to replace it. After doing so, he goes up in the cockpit \nthis time and he stowed the manual gear drop handle then he turned the  hydraulic pumps \non which made the gear doors go up crushing the ladder. Suggestion: I think the lead was \nin a rush and did not provide us with enough information for the job.  \nSynopsis  \nMaintenance technicians working on an A320 aircraft reported inadvertent gear retraction \ncausing minor injury to another technician."

We used the correct \nbrowser and serviced it properly IAW the manual, we all double checked the work to m ake \nsure it was serviced properly. During flight the flight crew got a message saying the IDG \ntemperature was too high. After landing the mechanics began troubleshooting the problem \nand saw a reddish color fluid, they believe its X but we don't have a X br owser we only \nhave a green browser (Y) and a purple browser (skydrol). When we serviced the IDG we \nopened up the lid of the browser and made sure it was [the] right fluid. As of right now \nthere is a sample of the fluid in the IDG that was sent out to be in spected for any \ncontaminates. Cause: Someone somewhere most likely serviced IDGs with a contaminated \nbrowser or serviced the IDG with a browser that said Y but had skydrol or X inside. \nSuggestions: Opening and emptying the browser to see the bottom half if  there's any \ncontaminates inside.  \nNarrative: 2  \nDuring the PS (Periodic Service Check) check of Aircraft X, we found both engines IDG \n(integrated drive generator) oil level below limits. We acquired the correct oil servicing \nunit and adapters, visually checked the content within the unit with our best a bility. Then \nmy 2 co -workers serviced one IDG each under my observation, afterwards we both \nvisually checked the oil level being within the limits after servicing and oil in the sight glass \nlooked normal, all maintenance actions are within the compliance o f required AMM. The \nplane flew the following day, and I was made aware that both IDG over heated with \npossible contamination noticed after the flight. I'm willing to cooperate with any \ninvestigation that may occur to bring this to a close and hopefully mak e improve for future \nmaintenance.  \nNarrative: 3  \nWe were assigned to do the PS (Periodic Service Check) check on Aircraft X A321 neo. \nDuring the check, we found both IDG (integrated drive generator) oil level low. IAW (In \nAccordance With) job card we were required to service both IDG IAW AMM as mentioned  \nin the job card. Technician Person 1 and Technician Person 2 brought the Y browser to the \nplane, I double checked the browser, it was the right one. We serviced both IDG between \nlimits as required by the AMM mentioned above. All the step was accomplished correctly. \nWe got the information that the red fluid was found mixed with the Y oil. I am pretty sure \nnow that the browser container was contaminated with the wrong fluid before we use that \nbrowser. We were unable to see it during the first drop before to service both IDG because \nwe work at night the vision is not so perfect. That unknown fluid might be at the bottom of \nthe browser. I propose the management to drop all the fluid inside of the browser. To \ninvestigate so that this serious incident never happened again.  \nSynopsis  \nMaintenance technicians serviced aircraft IDG with possible contaminated fluid."

While approaching the front of the hangar for \nparking, engines at idle coasting to the end of the lead in line while guide d by a \nmarshaller, I noticed a jolt just prior to reaching the end. It was at this time the \nmarshaller gave us a stop signal. At this time, I felt that we may have contacted the \naircraft parked to the left of us Aircraft Y since I ensured there were no obj ects on the \napron as we were approaching the hangar (i.e. chocks, cones, etc.). I then instructed the \nleft seat operator (Captain ’s seat) to set brakes and shut down both engines. I then \nradioed Ramp Control to notify them we were shut down and that movement was \nterminated at hangar. I then radioed my Supervisor and advised him that there may have \nbeen aircraft contact between the tw o aircrafts and that we would assess. Once I was \nremoved from the aircraft, I noticed that Winglet -to-Winglet and Strakelet -to-Strakelet \ncontact was made. I informed my Supervisor of the findings, asked him to come to our \nlocation, shut down the aircraft a nd secured the area.  \nNarrative: 2  \nDuring aircraft move from spot XX to hangar, left winglet of Aircraft X made contact with \nright winglet of Aircraft Y in front of hangar. I was performing the aircraft marshalling and \nit appeared that there was enough clearance from each aircraft winglet a s I was guiding \nAircraft X forward. From there as I was guiding Aircraft X the left winglet made contact \nwith the right winglet and aircraft movement was stopped in place.  \nNarrative: 3  \nI was assigned to taxi Aircraft X from gate XX to hanger. I picked up our marshaller in \nfront of the hanger and started my turn and approach. I noted that there was an aircraft \nto my left and where we were being marshaled into was close to that aircraft. I  mentioned \nto the right seater Person 1 that we looked close to the aircraft and proceeded to approach \nvery slowly. The person marshalling us, Person 2, has many years of experience \nperforming this duty. He could see better than I could how close we were. As we were \nmaking our closest approach to the other aircraft I slowed to a stop to allow for me to see \nhow close we were. I could not see my wing tip, and we were still being directe d to come \nforward which I complied with. I had to increase thrust to move the plane forward and as \nit did it started to pull to the left. I stopped immediately and shut down.  \nSynopsis  \nTwo onboard air carrier Mechanics and one Ground Marshaller reported a ground \nencounter with a parked aircraft during aircraft repositioning to a hangar. Marshaller \nstated he misjudged the lack of winglet clearance."

The valve stem \nassembly on the 737 MAX fleet MLG wheels do not have any safety device like safety wire. \nThis is a dangerous design flaw.

I personally feel responsible for not s aying or doing more to try and help \nprevent this given what happen.  \nNarrative: 2  \nUpon receiving information from the inspector after removing panels, I was told to get the \nsealant off until the strap was completely clean. After using the plastic scraper to get the \nthicker part of the sealant off then I moved to scotch bright. If I had gone to the manual \nand read, that I am to use the minimal amount of material to take the sealant off I would \nhave been aware of the fact that even scotch bright is unsafe to use. When the 400 -grit \nsandpaper was not working around the base of the high lock fastener I tried to get it off \nwith a scotch bright dremel pad. I mistook a grinding pad for a stiff scotch bright pad. \nAfter taking the grinding pad to the metal and it immediately took the primer off of the \nmetal I stopped. Due to not reading into the ma nual failed in adhering to rules against \ncertain materials used on the paint and primer of the failsafe strap. Suggestion: Better \ntraining on how to access branching aircraft maintenance manual references.  \nSynopsis  \nAircraft Maintenance Technicians reported improper removal of 737 -900 aircraft wing \nstructure protective coatings and material."

I asked the storekeeper if they need inspection tags. Person \ntold me no, the computer software system is designed for these parts to go rig ht to \nbinning after they process it. I told the person usually PSU panels have a shelf life, also \nHAZMAT if it has a O2 generator or not. So to put shelf life, need a tag. In this case, goes \nright to bin without a tag. I looked at the stock balance and it shows shelf life 180 months \nand HAZMAT part, tag - X- inspection -X. I told the person to hold the parts and notify \nLead to find out if it needs a tag. Very next day the record was changed to show inspection \n“Y”& tag “Y”but still show shelf life 180. Per GMM (General Maintenance Manual) it should \nshow “999,”which means have to go look up shelf life items, including vital information in \nnotes pertaining to the part number. Notes say if PSU has O2 generator, need to get the \npart number off the generator and go to Work Order to find out what the shelf life is. \nSome may have 12 years and some may have 15 -year shelf life depending the part \nnumber of the generator. Then shelf life is calculated to the lowest date on all the \ngenerators in PSU. This will not happen when you put a generic shelf life such as 180 \nmonths. PSU could end up with a 15 -year shelf life when actuality, generator may expi re \nin 12 years, 3 years out of date and expired generator could end up in bin or plane.  By \nlooking at the aviation maintenance software history it appears the stock balance is \nchanged on shelf life and HAZMAT, including tagging requirements by 3rd party \nindividuals, probably have not much experience in aircraft parts. At this stage, company is \nlooking at getting rid of inspection from all receiving parts and give that work to \nstorekeepers, Person A as a Quality Control Inspector is very concerned if that ’s the right \ndecision. If I did not h appen to walk by those parts and asked questions, would have gone \nto bin without a tag with no shelf life. Even if the shelf life shows does the storekeepers \nknow how to read notes and go to appropriate Work Order and tag the shelf life correctly? \nCurrentl y the stock balance shows a generic 180 months instead of “999.”Violation of \nGMM.  \nSynopsis  \nAircraft Technician reported PSU units with O2 generators were not being processed as a \nHAZMAT part and were being improperly tagged without the proper shelf life information."

All three mechanics were \nunfamiliar with job but were aware of the danger of fuel spilling. Arrived at aircraft, pulled \nbreakers before turning on power, and created logbook write -up shorty a fter. Turned on \npower, noticed it had 3000 fuel, and asked older mechanics about defueling but after \nlooking into the AMM (Aircraft Maintenance Manual). There was nothing that had details \nabout transferring fuel beforehand, so continued. Proceeded to use t he tool referenced in \nthe manual to unseat the valve and started turning. There was a little fuel dripping from \nthe seal as we turned it counterclockwise but not nearly enough for the manual that \nshowed maximum of one bucket, so we kept turning until it st arted to have a lot of \nresistance and then proceeded to open the drain plug because then manual said to after \nthe turning stopped. The drain plug showed no signs of fuel so we kept turning because \nthe manual said only in steps beforehand to check the fuel flowing from the valve only \nafter taking the assembly off. As we were turning the valve the keeper lock fell off from \nthe body and dropped into the bucket and then the valve gave out, dropping the cover \ninto the bucket and with a lot of resistance. We mana ged to lock the valve back in \npartially. I then had one of the mechanics go tell the Lead that we needed help and we \ntried to get the valve back in but it was locked in place. To add to this all three mechanics \nwere reading the manual independently and was n’t following one single person reading off \nthe manual. The reference to change the fuel pump had very vague points and at one \npoint told the Mechanic after taking the fuel pump off to gauge the amount that would \npossible to work with. The manual should refe rence fuel transferring beforehand to \nprevent larger spills along with a maximum amount of fuel total before using a fuel truck \nto drain the fuel if there is too much to transfer all in one wing. The manual highly \nhighlighted the danger of cutting safety w ire in red but had other warning orange.  \nNarrative: 2  \nWhen we were working on Aircraft X, my coworkers were changing left wing tank inboard \nboost pump. I was helping them after I had done my jobs on the aircraft. We followed \nAMM (Aircraft Maintenance Manual) steps to remove, but the boost pump is stuck and \nhard to remove. While I was reviewing the AMM to find a solution related to this problem, \nother technicians removed the pump but fuel was coming out from the bank. They tried to \nput the pump back to the tank to stop the fuel, but that did not work. So I help ed them \nput the bump back, also did not work. Because we could not stop and fuel leak, I went to \ngrab fuel leak kit to clean the fuel. At the same time we notified the supervisors.  \nNarrative: 3  \nI was following fuel pump AMM (Aircraft Maintenance Manual) task removal. Once the \npump was removed fuel came out after following step in accordance with AMM. Fuel was \nout on ramp. Then, we tried to reinstall pump but could not because retaining pin and \nspring assembly failed. I ask did we have to defuel but the AMM didn ’t call for a defuel.  \nSynopsis  \nA320 technicians reported the Aircraft Maintenance Manual (AMM) did not clearly provide \ndefuel instructions for a fuel pump removal procedure. After removing the pump, fuel \nbegan to leak, spilling all over on the ramp."

Other report [from weeks ago] of hot \nsection fires support the need to do a best practice leak check. In the interim while tooling \nand leak detector liquid are on order, I feel need to require EA be revised to require a high \npower engine run after fuel nozzles are replaced or proper nitrogen test equipment tooling \nand leak detector can be used.  Suggested resolution - an immediate resolution. In the \ninterim, while tooling and leak detector liquid are on delay due to availability of leak check \n- not owned - and tooling repairs needed, I relay this feedback from the technicians on the \nfloor: Require EA be revised to require a high power engine run after fuel nozzles are \nreplaced and a subsequent opening of the core cowls to inspect for fuel stains, leaks in \nmanifold, and nozzles area.  \nSynopsis  \nB737 Technician reported that an EA (Engineering Authorization) does not have a \nsufficient fuel nozzle leak check process after fuel nozzle post -replacement work is \ncompleted. If the leak test is not performed and a potential problem goes undetected, the \nreporter states that it can lead to in -service engine fires."

Prior to \ninstalling the steps on the aircraft the technician verified part number in the manufactures \nIllustrated Parts Catalog (IPC). It was found that the part number received was not \neffective for our serial number of aircraft. The technician notified maintenance control of \nthis discrepancy in hopes that they had documentation from the manufacturer stating we \ncould use the part number received. Maintenance control told the tech nician that we are \nallowed to use all the part numbers of stairs in the IPC no matter the effectivity. They \ncould not provide any documentation showing this from the manufacturer. After phone \ncalls from the manufacturer they stated they did not have any do cumentation showing all \nstairs were applicable to all serial number of aircraft. Maintenance control continued to try \nand pressure the technician into making a bad decision and install the stairs on the aircraft \nwithout documentation because they said and I quote \"We have been doing it like that for \nyears.\" This creates a bad culture, an unsafe aircraft condition and noncompliance with the \nmanufacturer manual. Encourage maintenance control to comply with the manufacturer \nmaintenance manual at all cost.  \nNarrative: 2  \nBeechJet 400XP was in for routine/ non -routine maintenance at ZZZ. A set of air -stair- \nstairs were to be replaced and a lead maintenance noticed the Parts Number (PN) on the \nmanual did not appear in the Illustrated Parts Catalog (IPC) Quality Control was a lerted. I \ncontacted Person A and was told to contact the Person B and another person. The answer \nwas the following from Maintenance Controller. \"The IPC doesn't list an effectivity code for \nthese stairs. They are approved for all 400 series aircraft. \" A m aintenance lead and I \nchallenged that answer and asked for something in writing that states we can install them \non the aircraft. I responded with: \"We can't force the installer to sign the release for this \nevent. If, the end user which determines airworthi ness of a part (mechanic) discovers a \nconflict in traceability and proper identification of the part he's doing the right thing no \nmatter the component. \"The manual is a document that provides the installer data to \ndetermine airworthiness, in this case the  installer has conflicting data.\" I/ we received the \nfollowing answer from Maintenance Controller.\" I'm done with this... rob the stair \nassembly or whatever parts need from Aircraft Y and get us a Color X aircraft please! \" \nUpon inspecting the stairs on th e other aircraft (donor) before removal the PN was \nchecked. It was discovered the effectivity is incorrect for the installation on the other \naircraft. Maintenance and Quality Control both were assertive with Maintenance Controller, \nand did not install the stairs that were to be removed and installed on the original aircraft. \nWe still had the effectivity issue. In the meantime, Quality Control and Maintenance at \nZZZ started email chains with Company explaining the issue. Maintenance and Quality \nControl were looking for a solution not engaging in a back and forth. I, being involved in \nthis issue began to gather information from individuals on the floor. A conversation took \nplace between Maintenance Controller and a maintenance lead. Paraphrasing the leads \nwords: [Instead of finding a solution they (Maintenance Controller) became more and \nmore agitated to the point it was bordering on a threat, it was very uncomfortable. They \nsaid we're just making stuff up cuz we don't want to fix it. Keeping this short as possible \nthe result was an inspector in ZZZ contacted Company and sorted out the eff ectivity and \nthe correct assembly that appears in the IPC was shipped and installed. My over all \nconcern is we are creating a hazard an opportunity for a safety escape. A quick example: a \nyoung mechanic and or an unassertive one feels the pressure installs  an incorrect part or \nsomething of that nature because Maintenance Controller is \"demanding it be done\". The \nnext time it could be a navigation download or incorrect push rod for a trim tab we must \naddress this issue. Company must update their IPC for the 400 which is the root cause for \nthis entire situation. Mechanics and pilots have a symbiotic relationship with one goal, \npreserving human life, by providing a safe product. Maintenance Controller must be \ntrained/ counseled covering what authority they have  and do not. Maintenance Controller \ndoes not have the final say, nor are in any position to demand anything that is obviously \noutside of FAR's, company manuals and Policy. Young mechanics need to be educated on \nthe exact role of Maintenance Controller and understand their direction and leadership \ncome from the Maintenance manager, production managers and leads not Maintenance \nController. Maintenance Controller does not make airworthy decisions for anyone, the \ntechs, leads, and pilots make that decision. Mai ntenance Controller does however, release \nthe aircraft back into service. However, that release is 100% predicated on the signatures, \npaperwork, and final determination of airworthiness completed by maintenance and \nQuality Control pilots.  \nSynopsis  \nAircraft Maintenance Technician reported pressure from Maintenance Control department \nto install incorrect part onto airplane."

I am a probationary \nmechanic with helicopter experience and King Air experience. I have no 737 or big jet \nexperience, none the less I went out with confidence in my abilities of reading th e manuals \nand the few months of experience on the aircraft. AMT 2 another probationary mechanic \nwith 4 months of experience on the aircraft came to help me out to the best of his \nabilities, He also has only 4 months of 737 experience. We arrived at the air craft and I \nhave personally never worked with the Multi -Functional Display (MFD) but tried to work \nmy way through it. We found that there was a #2 thrust reverser fault. We were first \ngoing to troubleshoot the TR (Thrust Reverser) by cycling it and running  a bite test. \nUnfortunately before we got to that we directed by the lead mechanic to defer the #2 TR. \nSo we started looking into the deferral procedure for the #2 TR in which me and AMT 2 \nhave never performed before. We started with adding the inboard TR lock to the #2 ENG \nthen came back up the ramp to read more into the deferral procedure. We had the gate \npersonnel hassling us on how long it will take along with the flight attendant who was very \nimpatient with us. We then added safety wire to the #2 TR to  restrict forward movement \nand then I got on the phone with maintenance control to verify all the procedures were \ndone properly. We then downgraded the aircraft to CAT 1 status and proceeded to fill out \nthe paperwork along with the aircraft log book paperw ork. At this point we were \napproached by the gate attendant who asked \"how much longer\". We proceeded to say we \nare just doing paperwork and will let you know but then the pilot said \"well if you guys are \njust doing paperwork we can start boarding so by th e time you are done the aircraft would \nbe boarded\". We finished the paperwork and added the correct placarding and sent the \naircraft on its way fully confidant for the safety of the passengers and crew. It wasn't till \nlater in the shift that AMT 2 informed  me that we never locked out the outboard TR with \nthe lockout bolt. We immediately went to supervision to notify them of the situation. I \ncontribute this to a lack of training on the aircraft. I have never deferred a thrust reverser \nin my career in aviatio n and felt thrown to the wolves. We were pressured by the flight \ncrew and the gate personnel. We believed that we performed everything correctly but \nfound a missed step in our deferral.  \nNarrative: 2  \nA fellow coworker received a gate call for a Max 8 for a maintenance light. I decided to go \nwith him and assist on the call. We both are on probation and have four months of 737 \nexperience under our belts. After arriving at the aircraft, we notice there wa s a fault for \nthe #2 Thrust Reversers. We decided to troubleshoot the T/R (Thrust Reverser) but was \nsoon directed by our lead mechanic to defer the T/R. Neither one of us has encountered \nthis problem before, so we started to look up the procedure for the deferral. First, we \nstarted the task by locking out the inboard TR. Next, we went back up to the jetw ay to \ncontinue reading the task. While reading and trying to figure out what to do next we were \nbombarded by flight attendants' and gate agent's impatiently asking questions on what is \nwrong, how much longer, why is it taking so long. Trying to handle the situation \naccordingly and professionally we continued with safety wiring the #2 TR handle to the \nstowed position. While my Fellow coworker was on the phone with Maintenance Control I \nwas filling out the logbook and trying to see how to downgrade the aircra ft to a CAT 1 \nstatus. During this process, we were still being asked questions about boarding and how \nlong it would take. Our response was we will let them know. We are working as fast as the \nmatter allows us. Then, the pilot told the gate agent that if th ey are doing the paperwork \nthey can start boarding now. Thinking that we performed the job correctly we released the \nplane back to the crew. It wasn't until later when I read the task again to get a better \nunderstanding without feeling pressured, rushed or  without proper guidance I recall that \nwe did not pin the outboard T/R sleeve. I brought it to my coworker's attention, and we \nimmediately notified our supervisors of our mistake.  \nSynopsis  \nMaintenance Technicians reported missing a procedural step when deferring a thrust \nreverser while the aircraft was at the gate prior to departure."
